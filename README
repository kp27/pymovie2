Welcome to my First Python Project.

Its a Django app that scrapes out boxoffice data from a couple of websites and aggregates the data. 
I originally had a bigger plan with this, but decided its not the project for me. 
Feel free to view it at MovieCombo.com .

These are the dependencies needed for this application. All in all you can set up a virtual env and dump this source at the same level as the env. The cron scripts (labeled as crom for some reason I am not willing to share!) will need
the path modified for use. In fact this is the linux shared setup vs the Macbook setup.

You'll notice the parsers use a file to keep track of the last movie parsed, it minimizes the number of hits to 90 a day and more importantly I can't run long lasting cron jobs on a share

These are the dependencies:


Beautiful Soup
South
HTML5Lib
Django
MySqlDb - MySQL-python
django-chart-tools
pil - PIL python imaging lib


Sources:
BoxOffice Mojo
IMDB
